#  Battery Management System (BMS) Using Machine Learning

Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting battery health and analyzing battery performance using Machine Learning algorithms.  
It helps in monitoring key parameters like voltage, temperature, and current, and identifying early signs of degradation or faults.  

The entire workflow — from data preprocessing to model evaluation — is implemented in Google Colab.
